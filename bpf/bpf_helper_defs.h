 * bpf_trace_printk
 *
 * 	This helper is a "printk()-like" facility for debugging. It
 * 	prints a message defined by format *fmt* (of size *fmt_size*)
 * 	to file *\/sys/kernel/tracing/trace* from TraceFS, if
 * 	available. It can take up to three additional **u64**
 * 	arguments (as an eBPF helpers, the total number of arguments is
 * 	limited to five).
 *
 * 	Each time the helper is called, it appends a line to the trace.
 * 	Lines are discarded while *\/sys/kernel/tracing/trace* is
 * 	open, use *\/sys/kernel/tracing/trace_pipe* to avoid this.
 * 	The format of the trace is customizable, and the exact output
 * 	one will get depends on the options set in
 * 	*\/sys/kernel/tracing/trace_options* (see also the
 * 	*README* file under the same directory). However, it usually
 * 	defaults to something like:
 *
 * 	::
 *
 * 		telnet-470   [001] .N.. 419421.045894: 0x00000001: <formatted msg>
 *
 * 	In the above:
 *
 * 		* ``telnet`` is the name of the current task.
 * 		* ``470`` is the PID of the current task.
 * 		* ``001`` is the CPU number on which the task is
 * 		  running.
 * 		* In ``.N..``, each character refers to a set of
 * 		  options (whether irqs are enabled, scheduling
 * 		  options, whether hard/softirqs are running, level of
 * 		  preempt_disabled respectively). **N** means that
 * 		  **TIF_NEED_RESCHED** and **PREEMPT_NEED_RESCHED**
 * 		  are set.
 * 		* ``419421.045894`` is a timestamp.
 * 		* ``0x00000001`` is a fake value used by BPF for the
 * 		  instruction pointer register.
 * 		* ``<formatted msg>`` is the message formatted with
 * 		  *fmt*.
 *
 * 	The conversion specifiers supported by *fmt* are similar, but
 * 	more limited than for printk(). They are **%d**, **%i**,
 * 	**%u**, **%x**, **%ld**, **%li**, **%lu**, **%lx**, **%lld**,
 * 	**%lli**, **%llu**, **%llx**, **%p**, **%s**. No modifier (size
 * 	of field, padding with zeroes, etc.) is available, and the
 * 	helper will return **-EINVAL** (but print nothing) if it
 * 	encounters an unknown specifier.
 *
 * 	Also, note that **bpf_trace_printk**\ () is slow, and should
 * 	only be used for debugging purposes. For this reason, a notice
 * 	block (spanning several lines) is printed to kernel logs and
 * 	states that the helper should not be used "for production use"
 * 	the first time this helper is used (or more precisely, when
 * 	**trace_printk**\ () buffers are allocated). For passing values
 * 	to user space, perf events should be preferred.
 *
 * Returns
 * 	The number of bytes written to the buffer, or a negative error
 * 	in case of failure.
